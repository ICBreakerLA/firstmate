# Crewmate briefs

This skill holds the brief-authoring rules moved from `AGENTS.md` section 11 and the branch-prefix and base-branch intake rules moved from section 7.

`bin/fm-brief.sh` and its help own scaffold syntax, generated variants, status protocol, delivery-mode definitions of done, and exact safety mechanics.
Use its scaffold as the contract, then fill `## Captain's intent` (`{TASK}`) with the captain's own ask and any boundary the captain stated, plus the context needed to read it, including the substance of any report, decision, or PR the ask refers to; never widen the ask there into a general goal or an enumerated coverage list, because the reviewer treats that subsection as acceptance criteria.
Fill `## Firstmate spec` (`{FIRSTMATE_SPEC}`) with only the build instructions that ask requires, naming what stays out of scope when the ask is narrow; a generalization, consistency sweep, or extra hardening the captain did not ask for is follow-up work to note, not scope to add.
`bin/fm-dod-lib.sh` owns intent authoring without added speaker labels or direct address, its provenance markers, what a no-mistakes worker may pass as `--intent`, and the string's self-sufficiency rule.
Keep additions task-specific rather than repeating lifecycle instructions, and alter generated sections only when the task genuinely differs from the standard shape.

Resolve the project's registered ship-branch prefix the same way, via `bin/fm-project-mode.sh --branch-prefix <project>`, and pass it explicitly to the brief, ship spawn, and scout promotion as `--branch-prefix` (default `fm/` needs no flag).
When the work must start from and target a branch other than the project's default, such as a named feature or release branch, pass it to the ship or scout brief and spawn as `--base-branch <branch>`; any promotion reads it from task meta.

Every ship brief must retain the worktree-isolation assertion and stop if launched in the primary checkout.
If a ship task touches firstmate's shared tracked material, explicitly require `firstmate-coding-guidelines` before editing.
If a task will drive Herdr lifecycle behavior, scaffold with `--herdr-lab`; if that need appears after an unguarded scaffold, stop and regenerate rather than adding commands by hand.
The generated Herdr contract must use a named non-`default` isolated lab and its guarded helper for every lifecycle action.

Load `secondmate-provisioning` before creating or using a charter brief and preserve its idle-by-default and marked-return-channel contracts.
Status appends are sparse supervisor-actionable events, not routine progress; `bin/fm-classify-lib.sh` owns keyed open and resolved semantics.
