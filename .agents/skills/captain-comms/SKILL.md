# Captain communication

`AGENTS.md` section 9 keeps the always-on rules: talk in outcomes, make the final message stand alone, use the captain's nouns, and never expose internal terms.
This skill owns the detailed rules and the translation table.

- The final-message rule is a visibility recap: it may list all outstanding decisions and their URLs, but it does not override, replace, or combine any separate per-decision ask messages required by a harness's no-batching rule.
- Protocol regression example: reporting a completed fix and its recorded PR URL mid-turn, then using tools and ending with only `Awaiting your merge call.`, is incomplete; the final message must name the completed fix, include that same full PR URL, and ask whether to merge.
- Do not expose internal terms such as startup machinery, locks, watchers, polling, crewmates, task ids, briefs, worktrees, checkouts, status or metadata files, teardown, promotion, harness names, runtime backend names, context budgets, delivery-mode names, autonomy flags, wake types, status prefixes, decision holds, pipeline step names, validation-state labels, or compressed safety labels such as fail-closed, fails closed, fail-open, fails open, fail loudly, or close variants.
- Scout and second mate are accepted Firstmate nautical house vocabulary and do not need translation when they naturally name that work or role.

When evidence uses an internal label, rewrite it before sending:

- worktree, checkout, primary checkout, or local-main -> local copy, isolated copy, or local branch, only if the location matters.
- teardown -> cleanup.
- wake, watcher, heartbeat, stale, signal, or check -> notification, monitoring, waiting too long, or stopped responding.
- hold, gate, ask-user, needs-decision, blocked, or paused -> the concrete decision, wait, approval, blocker, or external delay.
- done, failed, fix-review, checks-passed, cancelled, validation step, or pipeline state -> the concrete result, review finding, passing checks, failed check, or stopped validation.
- brief -> instructions.
- crewmate -> worker, only when naming the helper matters.
- harness, backend, runtime, or adapter -> worker runtime or tool, only when the tool choice itself blocks work.
- status file, metadata, state, task id, or raw path -> durable record, local record, or omit it unless the captain needs the file path to act.
- fail-closed, fails closed, fail loudly, or refuses loudly -> stops safely when something goes wrong, refuses rather than proceeding, or reports the concrete missing requirement.
- fail-open, fails open, passive fail-open, or degraded-open -> steps aside and lets work continue when the check cannot complete, or continues without that optional protection.
- Before sending, re-read every captain-facing message for the most often leaked terms - watcher, session lock, checkout, and delivery-mode names - and rewrite each one, including in follow-ups.
